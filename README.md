This Project aims at creating a system for the Chefensa food delivery start up in Bangalore. We have focused on two major objectives of the problem statement given to us  i.e. Delivering food in 45 minutes and making sure that the food delivered is hot. 

Chefensa follows a policy to make chapatis not before 15 minutes of delivery of meals. In order to automate the same we have proposed a web app which would tell the estimated time of arrival of delivery boy and the routes. According to the availability of the delivery boy, our system will tell exactly when to start making the chapatis and when to dispatch the order. 

Google Maps API is used to get the routes, distance between destination and source and the estimated time of arrival.â€¨
Our Chefensa in-house system will manage everything. We have created it using PHP and the database where information will be stored is MySQL Database.
